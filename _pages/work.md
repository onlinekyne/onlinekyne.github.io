I started making math videos online in 2020 on TikTok, and have since posted over 1000 videos across TikTok, Instagram and YouTube. I've also been a guest on several YouTube channels and podcasts, and I also have my own podcast, book, and blog.

## Podcast
My podcast _Think Queen with Kyne_ currently has 2 seasons or 16 episodes. I interview scientists, historians, linguists, and other fascinating people. Here's the [Spotify link](https://open.spotify.com/show/6o26mNVCXr6iJCyzo2jxkn?si=9a8dbf012c384d1e&nd=1&dlsi=f9926df198dc4e88) and the [Apple Podcasts link](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/think-queen-with-kyne/id1679005607).

I also collaborated with Scientific American in 2024 and co-created a 3-episode series for their podcast _Science, Quickly_, where I talk about the nature of math with mathematicians Tom Crawford, Eugenia Cheng, Craig Kaplan, and Mark Jago. [Learn more about that here](https://www.scientificamerican.com/author/kyne-santos/).

These are some projects I did for fun that I may or may not have covered in a blog post or video.
